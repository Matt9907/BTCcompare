Application built using React and Typescript to display the conversion rate of USD to BTC for the providers: Paybis, Guardarian, Moonpay, and Transak. Aircode.io was used to write the backend API for this project, and within Aircode the backend runs on scheduler that pulls conversion change and then caches the values to be pulled to the app itself.
